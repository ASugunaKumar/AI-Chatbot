# AI-Powered Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
This project contains the implementation of an AI-powered chatbot that leverages rule-based logic to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. Built using python, the chatbot processes user input, matches it against predefined rules and patterns, and generates appropriate replies. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new rules and response mechanisms.
